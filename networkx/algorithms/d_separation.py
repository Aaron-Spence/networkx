"""
Algorithm for testing d-separation in DAGs.

*d-separation* is a test for conditional independence in probability
distributions that can be factorized using DAGs.  It is a purely
graphical test that uses the underlying graph and makes no reference
to the actual distribution parameters.  For a detailed treatment see
[1]_, [2]_.

    """
    Return whether node sets ``x`` and ``y` are separated by ``z``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A NetworkX DAG.

    x : set
        First set of nodes in ``G``.

    y : set
        Second set of nodes in ``G``.

    z : set
        Set of conditioning nodes in `G`.

    Returns
    -------
    bool : True if ``x`` is d-separated from ``y`` given ``z`` in ``G``.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The *d-separation* test is commonly used with directed
        graphical models which are acyclic.  Accordingly, the algorithm
        raises a :exc:`NetworkXError` if the input graph is not a DAG.

    NodeNotFound
        If any of the input nodes are not found in the graph,
        a :exc:`NodeNotFound` exception is raised.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> g = nx.path_graph(10, nx.DiGraph)
    >>> assert nx.d_separated(g, {0,1,2,3}, {5,6,7,8,9}, {4})

    Notes
    -----
    While there are other algorithms for testing *d-separation* (for
    e.g. [3]_), the algorithm presented in [1]_ is perhaps the simplest
    linear time algorithm and is therefore used in this implementation.
